Loading and using TensorFlow models (such as `.h5` files) directly in Go is not as straightforward as in Python because the Go TensorFlow API has limitations and may not support all operations and model formats that the Python API does. However, TensorFlow does offer a Go API that you can use to load and run pre-trained models saved in the TensorFlow SavedModel format.

To use an `.h5` model in Go, you would typically need to convert it to a TensorFlow SavedModel format in Python, then use TensorFlow's Go API to load and run the model. Here’s how you can do it:

### 1. Convert the `.h5` model to TensorFlow SavedModel format in Python

First, convert your `.h5` model to the TensorFlow SavedModel format using Python:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the existing .h5 model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('path_to_your_model.h5')

# Save the model in TensorFlow SavedModel format
model.save('path_to_saved_model_directory', save_format='tf')
```

### 2. Use the TensorFlow Go API to load and use the model

After converting the model to the SavedModel format, you can use TensorFlow's Go API to load and run the model. First, you need to install the TensorFlow for Go package. You can find the instructions on the [TensorFlow Go API GitHub page](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/go).

Here’s an example of how you might load and use the SavedModel in Go:

```go
package main

import (
    tf "github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go"
    "github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go/op"
    "log"
)

func main() {
    // Load the SavedModel
    model, err := tf.LoadSavedModel("path_to_saved_model_directory", []string{"serve"}, nil)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error loading saved model: %s", err)
    }
    defer model.Session.Close()

    // Prepare the input tensor
    tensor, err := tf.NewTensor([1][1]float32{{0.0}}) // Example input, shape and data type should match your model's requirements
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error creating input tensor: %s", err)
    }

    // Run the model
    result, err := model.Session.Run(
        map[tf.Output]*tf.Tensor{
            model.Graph.Operation("input_layer_name").Output(0): tensor, // Replace "input_layer_name" with your model's input layer name
        },
        []tf.Output{
            model.Graph.Operation("output_layer_name").Output(0), // Replace "output_layer_name" with your model's output layer name
        },
        nil,
    )
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Error running the model: %s", err)
    }

    // Output the results
    log.Printf("Model output: %v", result[0].Value())
}
```

In this Go code:

- Replace `"path_to_saved_model_directory"` with the actual path to your SavedModel directory.
- Replace `"input_layer_name"` and `"output_layer_name"` with the actual names of your model's input and output layers. These names are defined in the TensorFlow model and can be viewed by inspecting the model in Python or using TensorFlow's `saved_model_cli`.

Keep in mind that using TensorFlow in Go might be limited to inference (i.e., making predictions with a pre-trained model). If you need to train or fine-tune models, it’s usually done in Python.

Also, TensorFlow’s Go API is not as comprehensive as the Python API, so some features might not be available or might require additional work to implement in Go.

## Load model from python training

To implement a function like `setModel` in Go, which sets up a model and loads weights for a sequence-to-sequence architecture (common in NLP tasks, such as machine translation), you would need to interact with a machine learning library that supports loading and running models, such as TensorFlow for Go. However, Go does not have native support for high-level operations like defining and training deep learning models in the way Keras does in Python. Typically, you would load a pre-trained model in Go, not set it up and train it from scratch.

Given these constraints, here’s how you can approach this task in Go:

1. **Export the pre-trained models from Python** as SavedModel files.
2. **Load the SavedModel in Go** and use it for inference.

Since the original Python function suggests a complex sequence-to-sequence model with separate encoder and decoder components, you would likely need to handle each component separately. Below is a conceptual approach to how you might structure this in Go, assuming the models are already trained and exported as TensorFlow SavedModel files:

### Python: Export Your Models
Ensure each part of the model (encoder, decoder) is saved as a SavedModel:

```python
enc_model.save('encoder_saved_model_path')
dec_model.save('decoder_saved_model_path')
```

### Go: Load and Use the Models

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	tf "github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tensorflow/go"
	"log"
)

// LoadModel loads a TensorFlow SavedModel from a specified path
func LoadModel(modelPath string) *tf.SavedModel {
	model, err := tf.LoadSavedModel(modelPath, []string{"serve"}, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to load model: %v", err)
	}
	return model
}

func main() {
	encoderModelPath := "path/to/encoder_saved_model"
	decoderModelPath := "path/to/decoder_saved_model"

	// Load the encoder and decoder models
	encoderModel := LoadModel(encoderModelPath)
	defer encoderModel.Session.Close()

	decoderModel := LoadModel(decoderModelPath)
	defer decoderModel.Session.Close()

	fmt.Println("Models loaded successfully")
	// Now you can use encoderModel and decoderModel for inference
}
```

In this Go code:

- `LoadModel` is a function that loads a TensorFlow SavedModel from a specified file path.
- `encoderModel` and `decoderModel` are loaded using this function.

This approach assumes you have the TensorFlow for Go API installed and correctly set up. The actual inference code (sending input data to the model and receiving output) will depend on the specifics of your model's inputs and outputs.

Because of the complexity of handling such models directly in Go, another common approach is to set up a microservice for your model in Python (using Flask, FastAPI, etc.) that exposes a REST or gRPC API. Your Go application can then make requests to this service to perform inference, which allows you to leverage Python's rich ecosystem for machine learning while still building the main application logic in Go.
